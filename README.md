## FastTensors

Pragmatic framework for those who want something like GGML or ONNX in pure Go.

Aimed to be 100% compatible with GGML and GGUF, as well support ONNX and safetensors models.

## V0 Roadmap - Fall'24

- [ ] Update the older code for better GGML compatibility
- [ ] Implement new operations needed for LLaMA v3 inference
- [ ] Allow GGUF format models to be read
- [ ] LLaMA v3.1 will work as FP32 / FP16 model on modern platrofrms

## V1 Roadmap - Winter'25

- [ ] Support some popular quantizations like Q6K or Q80
